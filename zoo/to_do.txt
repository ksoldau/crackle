animals
the lion and panda don't really mesh with the other animals

the habitat for the giraffe, lion have large objects in 
habitats that should be changed

the jungle background could be fixed and made to look 
more like the rest of them

also, REMEMBER to put things around in it's habitats
especially the sloth because might have to click things to "clean up"
in his habitat
